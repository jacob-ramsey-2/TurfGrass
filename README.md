# Turfgrass Weed Classification Research Project
## University of Tennessee - Department of Agriculture

This research project focuses on developing an automated system for identifying invasive weeds in turfgrass using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview

We are conducting research at the University of Tennessee's Department of Agriculture to create an AI-powered solution for weed identification in turfgrass systems. The project consists of three main phases:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Systematic collection of high-quality turfgrass images
   - Documentation of various invasive weed species
   - Utilization of a Sony A6700 camera with controlled settings for consistent image capture
   - Automated image storage in Google Cloud Storage for processing

2. **Model Development**
   - Creation of a foundational computer vision model
   - Development of an image classification system
   - Training the model on the collected dataset
   - Implementation of deep learning techniques for weed identification

3. **Model Testing and Validation**
   - Rigorous testing of the model's accuracy
   - Validation using new, unseen turfgrass images
   - Performance evaluation and metrics analysis
   - Refinement of the model based on test results



## Research Applications
This project aims to assist in:
- Rapid identification of invasive weed species
- Monitoring turfgrass health
- Supporting precision agriculture practices


## How to Learn the Project and Codebase

This project is in three different domains, AI programming, camera control programming, and overall linux operating system understanding. 

To get familiar with all of these domains see these courses:
- https://deeplizard.com/lesson/dla1zrlida
- https://learnxinyminutes.com/python/
- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-linux-basics

Once you are familiar with these basics, proceed to learning about this project:

There are [camera scripts](</camera scripts/README.md>) and [NVIDIA scripts](</NVIDIA scripts/README.md>). These are related README's inside of these folders.
